## Trinket Dom

A bare bones UI framework for browsers intended to expose developer to browser APIs and DOM manipulation
instead of wrapping.

Goals:

* Make coding fun like it was in 1984!
* Bias towards beginners learning to code rather than seasoned developers
* Use of compiler / build system / minification is discouraged
* With the above, deployed projects should always be editable.
* Also with the above, the chances of needing to upgrade dependencies becomes lower.
* Framework syntax is clearly marked by a `$` prefix on everything, providing a clear indication of browser native code vs. framework code.
* Zero dependencies
* Explicit naming is preferred over brevity

This isn't well optimized yet and therefore is currently useful for smaller projects.
