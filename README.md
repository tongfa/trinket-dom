## Trinkit

A bare bones UI framework intended to expose developer to browser APIs and DOM manipulation more so
than other UI frameworks.

Goals:

* Make coding fun like it was in 1984!
* Zero dependencies
* Use of compiler / build system / minification is discouraged
* editable source is encouraged
* creating archival quality apps that always work from the source level is possible
* Framework syntax is consistently marked providing a clear indication of browser native code vs. framework code. (currently uses `$` prefix)
* framework maintenance is greatly reduced over long run because of lack of dependencies
* Explicit naming is preferred over syntax brevity

While this project works, it isn't well optimized yet and therefore is currently useful for smaller projects. I would think other modern frameworks would be more performant.
